    <h1>Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, While I websurfed, weak and weary,<br />
    Over many a strange and spurious web site of hot dates galore,<br />
    While I clicked my fav&lsquo;rite bookmark, Suddenly there came a warning, And my heart was filled with mourning, Mourning for my dear amour.<br />
    &lsquo;Tis not possible!&rsquo;, I pleaded, But my browser, so conceited, Remained blank, I then repeated, Just a blank and nothing more.<br />
    With a scream, I was defeated, For my cookies were deleted, So I begged, no longer seated, &ldquo;Give me back my dear amour!&rdquo;<br />
    Then, in answer to my query, Through the net I loved so dearly, Came its answer, dark and dreary:</p>
    <p className="fourOhfour">Quoth the server, 404</p>
